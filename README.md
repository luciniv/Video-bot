# 'Demos' Discord Bot 
> Dummy code for running a Discord Bot via Discord.py

Hey! This repository contains the code for a Discord Bot designed to demonstrate asynchronous programming. The bot supplies a few simple functions, including a ping, server stats viewer, and call to a riddle API. Extra output logging indicates the start and stop times of each function.

## Operation
- Clone this repository and follow Discord's guidelines for creating a Discord bot
- Invite the bot to a server of your choice, preferably with Administrator permissions (bot scope)
- Supply the ['YOUR TOKEN HERE'] section in run.py with your bot's token (DO NOT MAKE THIS PUBLIC)
- Run run.py to start up the bot
- Use !sync or !s to sync slash commands globally (refresh your client afterwards)
- Aaand you're done
